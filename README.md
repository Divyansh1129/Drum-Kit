# Drum-Kit

A simple and interactive Drum Kit web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can play different drum sounds either by clicking on the on-screen buttons or by pressing specific keys on the keyboard. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio playback in JavaScript.
